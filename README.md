# functional-web-apps
This is a project for CS 242 (Programming Languages) at Stanford University.
It includes two implementations of a simple web application for viewing and modifying a catalog of swing dance moves.
The application is implemented in [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) and in [Reason](https://reasonml.github.io/) (using [ReasonReact](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/)).
Both languages ultimately compile to JavaScript.
Instructions for running each version of the application are available in their respective READMEs.

This repository also includes a non-interactive, HTML/CSS version of the user interface in the `html` directory.
