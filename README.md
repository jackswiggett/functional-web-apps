# functional-web-apps
This is a project for CS 242 (Programming Languages) at Stanford University.
It includes two implementations of a simple web application for viewing and modifying a catalog of swing dance moves.
The application is implemented in [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) and in [Reason](https://reasonml.github.io/) (using [ReasonReact](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/)).
Both languages ultimately compile to JavaScript.
Instructions for running each version of the application are available in their respective READMEs.
The compiled JavaScript output from each version of the application is also provided for convenience in `compiled-output.js`.

This repository also includes a non-interactive, HTML/CSS version of the user interface in the `html` directory.
